# Our Introduction

Namaste! We are the students of Rishihood University located in Sonipat, Haryana. We are currently pursuing our first year bachelorate degree.
we are currently studying a course in our collage called UNDERSTANDING INDIA which teaches us about the history and culture of India and from there we got the interest in this field.
We are open to future opportunities like this with full interest and dedicaton.
# Why we chose Mandala 1

Mandala 1 of the Rigveda holds profound significance as the opening book of humanity's oldest sacred text,
containing 191 hymns that establish the philosophical and spiritual foundation for the entire Vedic corpus.
It strategically begins with the first word "Agni" (divine fire), symbolizing the power of will that introduces all other divine forces into human consciousness.

# Primary Deities and Themes

The hymns are predominantly addressed to Agni (fire), Indra (divine mind), and Varuna, with specific hymns dedicated to Vishnu (1.154-1.156) and the Ashvins.
Agni represents not merely physical fire but the essence of energy in all formsâ€”material (mechanical, electrical, nuclear) and non-material (thoughts and will).
The text portrays deities as collaborative friends and co-creators with humans rather than distant supreme beings
